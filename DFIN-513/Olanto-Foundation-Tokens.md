# Abstract

I would like to propose a new model of ICO targeting fund raising for Free Software communities developing solutions for decentralization.  In this model ICO participants do not buy the token, but rather lend us their Ethers for minimal period of 3 years. While not spending any of the borrowed  Ethers, we use them to provide services to the underlying Ethereum infrastructure and using the annuities to fund new developments.  The tokens distributed in exchange  of borrowed Ethers may be viewed as the main token, and holders of this token will be rewarded with large majority of new application-tokens developed under this funding.


# Introduction

Most of the ICOs today are targeting to collect maximum amount of money. Most of them under-perform compared to the native token of the underlying blockchain used during the ICO.  So in most cases participants would have a better financial situation by not participating and keeping their funds in the native token. (ie Ethers)

Such ICOs are money printing. They introduce inflation to the crypto-currencies space and quite often they make Ether price more volatile by selling Ethers in huge quantities to cash out rather than re-invest in technology and decentralization.

Olanto Foundation will not spend any of the borrowed Ethers. In my proposed schema we borrow Ethers for a minimal period of 3 years.  During this period we will use this amount to provide low risk services to the underlying Ethereum infrastructure and the foundation will use the small revenues from this services to actually fund our developments. 

In my proposed schema Olanto Foundation borrows Ethers for a minimal period of 3 years. During this period Olanto will use these funds to provide low risk services to the underlying Ethereum infrastructure such as staking. Only the rewards from these services will be spent to fund Olanto projects. For every project that Olanto affords to develop, a majority of each projects app-tokens will be airdropped to the participants of the inceptive ICO.

This way is not only preserving the initial investments, but is also forcing us to provide services to the underlying blockchain infrastructure.

For the sake of this paper Olanto Foundation1 will be used as an example of a such a novel and yet atypical non-speculative fund-raising model.

So let's discuss OFT - Olanto Foundation Token to finance Free Software development in the area of CAT (Computer Assisted Translation), MT (Machine Translation), text indexing & searching and all kind of natural language processing tools.


# Motivation

Being co-founder and volunteering as member of the board for Olanto Foundation (Open Language Tools) for more then 5 years I think an ICO will hugely help to finance more rapid development of the Foundation's Free Software tools, but I am really uncomfortable with most of the ICO models I have observed so far.  Most of them heavily under-perform compared to Ethereum or Bitcoin. Why would one spend his ETH/BTC to invest in a such ICO ? They also tent to create money out of fin air causing inflation in crypto-currency space. The resulting app-token is often
over-valued as it's price is first set artificially during the ICO.

Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin says about ICOs: "A lot of projects will fail and people will lose money."2

I am utterly choked by the number of ICOs turning into Fraud as a Service (FaaS). This is what pushed me to develop a more sustainable ICO model.

# Current ICO landscape

Unprecedented market capitalisation success of Bitcoin & Ethereum made many traditional players absolutely thriving to repeat such success and make even more money with new coins. This crowd of actors do not stimulate innovations & technical solutions, moreover, they do not understand decentralized platforms and therefore many of new token are stillborn. The biggest effect they make is to warming up investors and making crypro-currency market even more speculative. As a result it leads to hysterical investments trying to repeat Bitcoin & Ethereum success by technically non-qualified investors. 

All these tokens have very over-stated valuation.

Some rare ICOs have real sense, but most are parasitizing the underlying infrastructure without proposing anything new.

Most of these tokens are performing less than the initial Ethers invested. 

As I mentioned before, current ICO system and approach is quite compromising and destroying for crypto-currency ecosystem in general. Endless speculation create Ponzi attitude in a grand public and maybe extremely damaging for the crypto-community in general. 

Vitalik Buterin in his last paper "Interactive Coin Offering"4 says : "What this all serves to show is that relying purely on the medium-of-exchange argument to support a token value, while attractive because of its seeming ability to print money out of thin air, is ultimately quite brittle. Protocol tokens using this model may well be sustained for some time due to irrationality and temporary equilibria where the implicit cost of holding the token is zero, but it is a kind of model which always has an unavoidable risk of collapsing at any time." 

In this landscape here are different options for a crypto-currencies holders:
    
In this landscape, there are four different groups of investors:
1) participate with his ETH in a very successful ICO where the resulting token worth more than ETH,
2) participate in an ICO token finally performing under ETH,
3) just hold to ETH and do not invest in any ICO,
4) not only hold your ETH, but use them to provide services and gain small benefits on providing a better infrastructure.

So rare successes, many loses and not so much new developments in term of decentralization.

# Contributions

We are proposing a new model where people do not spend, but only lend for a minimum 3 years period. 

I believe our ICO approach will introduce several innovations in the landscape:

1) we do not spend any of the Ethers borrowed as the result of the ICO. 
2) we finance our developments by providing services to the underlying Ethereum blockchain infrastructure and community. We leverage on the time value of money.3 
3) the app-tokens consequent to our development will distributed in large majority to OFT token owners thus starting with a purely market valuation and not some pre-fabricated price. Starting at zero price and leaving the free market decide the price.

# Implementation

We provide a Time Lock for invested Ethers, to ensure that their funds are solely used for blockchain infrastructure services. We then reward these investors with the new app-tokens from Olanto developped projects.

We first intend to use a multi-sig wallet with let's say a 7 of 12 threshold with known people from the community as signers.

We intend to work with communities developing PoS, Casper, Plasma, Cosmos and Lightning systems to safely evaluate our use of the system.
Funds will be allocated to such network protocols in order to provide liquidity to the network and thus creating a small funding stream for Olanto Foundation.

PoS and similar techniques are only affordable to technically very skilled investors with substantial liquidity. We aim to use this potential to generate revenues for the Foundation while securing the the participants and rewarding them with resulting app-tokens.

Our approach offers a low risk return with app-tokens with full initial capital preservation.

Banks where used to pool money and to provide this investment pools to valuable startups, and other projects. Now days tools such as Initial Coin Offering (ICO) and Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) can be used not only to pull funds for such project, but also to implement a distributed governance on such projects without any trusted intermediary7. Please note also that selection of the valuable project for such investment is not any more a Bank's monopoly, but can be rather selected directly by the people who provides the funds.

On the other side banks start to play with crypto and our OFT token sound like an interesting proposal with extremely limited risks.

# OFT

Olanto Foundation Coin Offering will be implemented as ERC20/ERC23 compatible smart-contract. The token will be introduced during one
year period in exchange of lending us Ethers for a minimal period of 3 years. We will potentially accept other solid digital assets 

# Return on Investment

We target a very conservative 2% RoI to finance our development.  While OFT holder's RoI will be a full ETH reimbursement and all developed app-tokens as bonus.

Dash' Master Nodes PoS currently show ~10% annual return in the internal dash currency for running a Master Node and staking dash thus insuring services and security for the the underlying blockchain. 

Let's suppose we are able to receive 50Mio USD equivalent in ETH. 2% annuities would provide us with a very comfortable 1Mio per year budget without touching the core of borrowed money. 

To achieve this, transparency of how funds are used & are accessible is crucial. OFT token buyer can only receive their ETH back after a 3-year period to ensure stability of our model. However, they should be able to see the account in which their money resides and they should be granted immediate access to their funds once the 3 year period is over.

Moreover the OFT token itself can be traded on the decentralized markets.

It is difficult to tell what would be the valuation of Foundation's app-tokens, but since we airdrop them to OFT token holders absolutely for free - they will benefit from a totally free market valuation.  It seems to me a more simple and natural approach to the token valuation problems expressed by the community.4,6 

# Legal framework

I am not a lawyer and all of above proposed should be discussed with a group of lawyers in a local jurisdiction, nevertheless the general idea is that the borrowed money should not be considered as owned by Olanto Foundation capital.

Ideally the capital should be owned by a DAO or a simpler form of smart contract and providing Olanto Foundation with a funding stream. 

Issued app-tokens are not sold, but airdroped for holding OFT tokens. It will be interesting to see how this will be considered in the current and future law.


# Limitations and Benefits

Any approach have it's own limitations and benefits. Let's try honestly discuss both in this section.

## Limitations

This is not a 0% risk as we would all love to have. We will try to minimise the risks by working with concerned development communities.

PoS is not yet implemented in Ethereum, nobody know how smooth will this migration go. 

We have to carefully evaluate what gains can be currently generated using such technique. 

## Benefits

The proposed model of ICO is less risky than any traditional ICO in term of capital preservation.

At the same time we foster development of Free Software tools in natural language processing and provide services to the Ethereum blockchain infrastructure and community. 

Our ICO model provides a free market based valuation for our app-tokens.

The borrowed Ethers are not completely locked out economy, they are used to provide more liquidity on the market by putting them at use for PoS and second layer transactions.


# Conclusions

We propose a different approach to finance Free Software projects, where we want to use ETH received from OFT sales for continuous return on investment using PoS mining and gain a steady return on investment.  Low-risk profits from PoS systems (lighting network, tendermint, casper, ...), will allow us to fund development of Olanto software and bring value to OFT holders by giving them new Olanto project app-tokens as they come, for free. 

## Future work

While this paper describes a general idea, we now need to work on actual implementation. 
Smart contracts have to be developed.

As soon as a stable DAO capable of providing PoS style services and thus capitalizing on the provided services will be possible we are willing to switch to this kind of total decentralization.
