BITCOINS ARE NOT MONEY

Dear friends, 

Last few weeks many of you were asking me if "bitcoins are real money" and if you should jump into the crypto-currencies, also "if it is not too late to invest?", and so on... Let me answer all of your questions with this blog post.

So first - are Bitcoins real money ? Friends, NO ! I think it's not. 

Money is a social phenomenon. A social need that we have to facilitate our transactions. Money is something we agree on. That means that all actors accept it as being money. In the modern society, most jurisdictions agreed to declare national currencies as legal tender. A sovereign money. It derives its value by being declared by a government to be legal tender; that is, it must be accepted as a form of payment within the boundaries of the country, for "all debts, public and private". These choices were made consciously to be able to control the economy at the national level. This is the reason why in France the national sovereign money was called a Franc. France has longly discussed entering or not into the European currency and the â‚¬ zone because they should have given up Franc as a national currency which was strongly associated to the name of the country and its sovereignty.

The main functions of money in modern societies are: a unit of account, medium of exchange and store of value. Those functions are independent but mutually reinforcing.

Unless you are a total freak, Bitcoin is not a unit of account. This is because Bitcoin's price has extreme volatility. 
In short terms Bitcoin is a terrificly bad store of value. In particular because of Bitcoin's price volatility. In long terms - so far so good, but who knows ?! What if the cryptography behind bitcoin network is suddenly hacked ?! And what if we will see splits like Bitcoin & Bitcoin Cash multiplied ?! Like thousands of them ?!
Since Bitcoin is  a bad unit of account, currently medium of exchange involves transactions (including exchanges to local units of account) which cannot be executed at the same time and the value of Bitcoin may dramatically and unpredictably change meanwhile. So having unpredictable rates Bitcoin is a bad medium of exchange.

Many people studied how to create the best money possible for the society. And the monetary policy of Bitcoin reflects nothing of this. Since people started to have saving, the world leading economists started to develop models that will allow to stimulate economic growth. Bitcoin does not take into account previous knowledge of the development of a monetary system, it is a pure product of IT development based on crypto-economic rules.

The simple fact that we are still talking about "if Bitcoins are real money or not" already indicates that there is no general consensus on this issue. And so it is not.

Today I think the Bitcoin's adoption threshold is clearly not passed. So you may experiment with this yet primitive 'decentralized electronic cash system' that looks more as digital version of a Rai Stone, but calling this hard money is overstated in my opinion. Rai Stones are still here, will Bitcoin survive centuries ?

Bitcoin is still in it's premature age somewhere between innovators and early adopters. Being a system that gives enormous privileges to early adopters, I doubt very much that it can achieve a broader adoption by a large population understanding the unfairness of the distribution. 

As far as decentralization is concerned - Bitcoin  mining is actually more centralized then Gold mining.

From environmental and sustainable development point of view Bitcoin is absolute evil. Currently Bitcoin is rated as approximately 70th position of the world's list of countries by electricity consumption. The electricity consumption of the entire World Banking system is less compare to Bitcoin mining consumption while serving at least half of the world population, where Bitcoin serves only few millions of users.
Some altcoins (alternatives to Bitcoin crypto-currency) including Ethereum are experimenting with Proof of Stake (PoS) instead of Proof of Work (PoW). If successful this should bring us to at least a sustainable growth of the crypto-currencies users. 

I my opinion Bitcoin is not money, but can be considered as a global experiment. A first of a kind. Many others are following and will follow. Would Bitcoin or any further crypto-currency become real money - I really doubt.

In conclusion, I consider that technologies behind Bitcoin, Ethereum and some other crypto-currencies are interesting and that the money in the future may be based on some of these technologies. But we are not yet there. Some of the aspects of each of this technologies are immutable - no upgrades possible. While this is presented as a feature this make me less certain that Bitcoin is the one. For instance, I think that there is no possibility to upgrade from PoW to PoS in Bitcoin. Lots of experimentations and iterations will be needed in order to create a technology that will satisfy the needs of billions of users.

Friends, I hope I convinced you not to consider Bitcoin as money, but to explore it  as a new and yet little-known technology that still needs a lot of development.
