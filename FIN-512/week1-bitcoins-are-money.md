BITCOINS ARE MONEY

Dear friends, 

Lately many of you were asking me if "bitcoins are real money", what is backing bitcoins, if you should jump in to the crypto-currencies and also "if it is not too late to invest?". Let me answer to all of your questions with this blog post.

My answer is YES, bitcoins are real money ! It's even more - it's an Internet of Money. It is radically new form of money having new qualities and properties we have never seen before. It's even more - an open, public distributed ledger. The main innovation and feature of bitcoin, in my opinion, is the consensus mechanism. It helps to maintain a distributed ledger of transaction, but it is also a new type of network-centric model of organisation that does not depend on traditional institutions. Think of it as post-industrial and post-institutional money. Bitcoin eradicate borders and eliminate centralisation. It does to Money what the Internet did for the Information for society. 

Money is a social phenomenon. A social need we have to facilitate our transactions. Money is something we agree on. If some of us agree to use bitcoin as money - well, than it's money. With Bitcoin as with any network centric technology we can see a huge network effect. The growth of adoption of Bitcoin and therefore bitcoin price is following an S-Curve of Technological Adoption, which itself characterised by fractal repeating, exponentially increasing Gartner Hype Cycles. We are somewhere in the early stage of Bitcoin adoption. In my point of view the S-Curve "vertical" is yet to come.

Money is any item or verifiable record that is generally accepted as payment for goods and services. The main functions of money are distinguished as: a medium of exchange; a unit of account; a store of value; and, sometimes, a standard of deferred payment. Any item or verifiable record that fulfils these functions can be considered as money. Bitcoin has all previously mentioned specifications, and seems highly superior in durability, transportability, divisibility, non-counterfeitability, fungibility, so it's already a perfect medium of exchange. Especially now that we have the second layer of Lightning Networks. In long term (after the late majority opt-in) price volatility will be reduced and having a global adoption Bitcoin will become a perfect unit of account and store of value. 

Bitcoin’s trust is based on human faith in mathematical algorithms. In fact as well as trust in gold is based on lot of knowledge and faith in chemistry. For most of us who are not studying history of money the trust in gold is based on the multi-generational culturally transmitted faith. One day bitcoin will be certainly as unquestionable as gold.

Concerning Ripple and other scam tokens, I believe that any proprietary/private/centralized blockchain will fail as every proprietary intranet using TCP/IP failed to surpass the development of the Internet and only became another network connected to the public Internet. And even if countries will issue ERC20 tokens on Ethereum as sovereign money, the transaction fees for the underlying infrastructure will be paid in Ethers. (or in bitcoins if a government decides to issue a token using Bitcoin network)

In conclusion I consider that the technologies behind Bitcoin, Ethereum and some other crypto-currencies are highly disruptive technologies and the money of the future will be based on blockchain. Bitcoin is the first and the biggest open experiment.
All countries have seen lots of currency changes without collapsing. For example in the recent history France is using Euros (€) after the French Francs which followed the "old French Francs". I think Bitcoin is the money of today and of at least some foreseeable future.

Dear friends, I hope I convinced you that bitcoins are money. But instead of asking me for investment advises, let me suggest you to learn more about decentralization, blockchain, crypto-currencies and ICOs by following the Massive Open Online Course (MOOC) of the University of Nicosia. This MOOC is part of the MSc I am following. https://digitalcurrency.unic.ac.cy/free-introductory-mooc/
